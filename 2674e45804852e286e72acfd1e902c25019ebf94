Read plan file\n2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan\n3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting\n4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed\n\n### Step 2: Execute Batch\n**Default: First 3 tasks**\n\nFor each task:\n1. Mark as in_progress\n2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)\n3. Run verifications as specified\n4. Mark as completed\n\n### Step 3: Report\nWhen batch complete:\n- Show what was implemented\n- Show verification output\n- Say: \"Ready for feedback.\"\n\n### Step 4: Continue\nBased on feedback:\n- Apply changes if needed\n- Execute next batch\n- Repeat until complete\n\n### Step 5: Complete Development\n\nAfter all tasks complete and verified:\n- Announce: \"I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work.\"\n- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch\n- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice\n\n## When to Stop and Ask for Help\n\n**STOP executing immediately when:**\n- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)\n- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting\n- You don't understand an instruction\n- Verification fails repeatedly\n\n**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**\n\n## When to Revisit Earlier Steps\n\n**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**\n- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback\n- Fundamental approach needs rethinking\n\n**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.\n\n## Remember\n- Review plan critically first\n- Follow plan steps exactly\n- Don't skip verifications\n- Reference skills when plan says to\n- Between batches: just report and wait\n- Stop when blocked, don't guess\n","tools":{"read":9,"edit":8,"write":2},"duration":479},{"id":2,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T18:57:24.232Z","content":"I dislike this API.
