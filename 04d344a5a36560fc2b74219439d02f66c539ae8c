The README currently documents two of the three `in_container` overloads (image and path/tag) and needs the factory added in the same style.\n\n## Changes\n\n**File: `README.md`**\n\n### 1. Add \"Custom Container Factory\" subsection under Usage (after \"Test Across Multiple Images\", before \"How It Works\")\n\nShows when and why to use a factory — the answer is container customization (env vars, volumes, ports, network config) that the image/build modes don't support. Includes a practical example with `with_env`.\n\n### 2. Add `in_container(factory=...)` entry to API Reference (after the `path, tag` entry, before the marker entry)\n\nTerse signature + one-liner, matching the existing API Reference style. Mentions the `ContainerFactory` type.\n\n## Verification\n\n- Read the final README and confirm the new sections follow the existing tone, formatting, and level of detail.\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/marko/.claude/projects/-Users-marko-Desktop-pytest-inside-docker/24c27809-f8f4-475b-b5e0-9262daabab12.jsonl","tools":{"read":10,"edit":2},"duration":43}],"startedAt":"2026-02-09T19:29:37.708Z"}},"files":{"README.md":[{"session":"16408bad7abecf14","lines":"123-157,212-221","prompt":10}]}}
