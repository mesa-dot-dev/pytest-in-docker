The README currently documents two of the three `in_container` overloads (image and path/tag) and needs the factory added in the same style.\n\n## Changes\n\n**File: `README.md`**\n\n### 1. Add \"Custom Container Factory\" subsection under Usage (after \"Test Across Multiple Images\", before \"How It Works\")\n\nShows when and why to use a factory — the answer is container customization (env vars, volumes, ports, network config) that the image/build modes don't support. Includes a practical example with `with_env`.\n\n### 2. Add `in_container(factory=...)` entry to API Reference (after the `path, tag` entry, before the marker entry)\n\nTerse signature + one-liner, matching the existing API Reference style. Mentions the `ContainerFactory` type.\n\n## Verification\n\n- Read the final README and confirm the new sections follow the existing tone, formatting, and level of detail.\n\n\nIf you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /Users/marko/.claude/projects/-Users-marko-Desktop-pytest-inside-docker/24c27809-f8f4-475b-b5e0-9262daabab12.jsonl","tools":{"read":10,"edit":2},"duration":135},{"id":11,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:31:52.970Z","content":"Add the discord chip in the README from\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@mesadev/agentblame)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@mesadev/agentblame)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/Discord-Join%20us-5865F2?logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.gg/2vvEJFrCHV)","tools":{"read":1,"edit":1},"duration":102},{"id":12,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:33:34.515Z","content":"The mark spec doesn't appear to support the factory API, let's make that work","tools":{"read":13,"edit":1},"duration":83},{"id":13,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:34:57.800Z","content":"I would prefer if we made the type-signature safer in the build_container_spec_from_args, as well as add overloads in it","tools":{"read":4,"edit":6},"duration":109},{"id":14,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:36:46.648Z","content":"The cleaner approach is to completely change the type signature of\n\ndef build_container_spec_from_args(*args: str, **kwargs: str | ContainerFactory) -> ContainerSpec:\n","tools":{"edit":1,"read":1},"duration":71},{"id":15,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:37:57.562Z","content":"Yeah, but you can also extract *args and **kwargs too, similarly to \n\ndef in_container(\n    image: str | None = None,\n    *,\n    path: str | None = None,\n    tag: str | None = None,\n    factory: ContainerFactory | None = None,\n) -> Callable[[Callable[P, T]], Callable[P, T]]:\n","tools":{"read":2,"edit":1},"duration":45},{"id":16,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:38:42.254Z","content":"This feels like it could be commonized between this and in_container, no?","tools":{"read":7,"edit":4},"duration":577},{"id":17,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:48:19.121Z","content":"review the code changes i made in pytest_in_docker/_container.py","tools":{"read":1},"duration":42},{"id":18,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:49:01.039Z","content":"fix all four issues","tools":{"edit":5},"duration":84},{"id":19,"timestamp":"2026-02-09T19:50:24.892Z","content":"⏺ Next issue: Debian's PEP 668 \"externally managed environment\" blocks pip install without a venv. pytest-in-docker's bootstrap_container runs pip  \n  install rpyc pytest but Debian refuses it.                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                    \n  Two options — either pytest-in-docker should create a venv or pass --break-system-packages, or we can pre-install rpyc and pytest in the\n  Dockerfile so bootstrap doesn't need to install them.
